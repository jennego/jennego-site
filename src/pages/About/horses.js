        I only ride one horse right now. I am an adult amateur. I am somewhere
        between a casual rider and a serious insane competitive rider. Yes, I
        will ride in the rain but I rarely compete and I am a terrible trainer
        because no one believes me (especially ponies).
      </p>
      <p>
        I ride between Training and First Level and am currently trying to wrap
        my brain with Second-level lateral work. It turns out you need to figure
        out the shape and where all the parts go before you can attempt to ride
        it...kinda like developing without a wireframe in mind.
