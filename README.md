### To do

- be more consistent with colours / tidy sass

- add accordion to menu - ? do I still need this / how to use with path matching
- make video modal accessible / autoplay? / add description
- add modal for more in textblock (photo pages) - later?
- about pages subpages ?
- Animation

- Font Awesome
- Bootstrap / Reactstrap
